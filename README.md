## Why? ## 
This project addresses the problem of noisy log anomaly detection by leveraging self-supervised sequence embeddings, enabling accurate detection with minimal labeled data while improving robustness to unseen patterns.

## Success Metrics ##
Classification → accuracy, F1, ROC-AUC (area under the reciever operating characteristics curve)
Regression → MAE (mean absolute error), RMSE (root squared mean error)
Ranking → MRR (mean reciprocal rank), NDCG (normalized discounted cumulative gain)
