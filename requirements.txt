# Top-level Python dependencies for HDRP.
#
# This consolidates the service requirements and ensures that the CLI
# (including Tavily-powered search) has the libraries it needs.
#
# Core service dependencies (mirrors HDRP/services/requirements.txt)
grpcio>=1.50.0
grpcio-tools>=1.50.0
openai>=1.0.0
pydantic>=2.0.0
protobuf>=4.0.0

# CLI is stdlib-only (argparse), but we document Tavily usage:
# Tavily search is accessed via HTTPS using urllib in HDRP/tools/search/tavily.py
# and does not require an extra Python package.
